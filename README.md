# Number-Slider-Puzzle 🔢⬇️➡️⬆️⬅️
This repository contains the code for my first python project, a number slider puzzle, where the player must swap number tiles adjacent to a blank tile such that the numbers end up arranged in ascending order and the blank tile is at the end. 

## How It Works 📜:
* **A 3x3 grid of numbers from 1-8 is generated, with the numbers already in ascending order but interrupted by a blank tile.**
* The player will be prompted to type in a number to swap the blank tile with. 
* The number typed must be orthagonally adjacent to the blank tile, it cannot be diagonal to the blank tile, if it is, the program will print that the move is invalid ❌.
* If the puzzle is solved, the player is told the number of moves it took them to win; only valid moves are counted.
* If the player wishes to quit the game, they must type "quit" instead of a number.
